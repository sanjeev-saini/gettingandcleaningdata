### **Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Project** ###

### Overview ###

This codebook lists the variables in the data file 'MeanActivityDetails.txt', which is the dataset generated after running the code in 'run_analysis.R'.

This tidy data file contains 180 observations. A row in the tidy data set is an observation of each of the 6 activities for a subject, along with the mean and standard deviation of 33 base variables analyzed by the HAR research team.  The tidy data set contains a total of 68 variables.

The variable names have been modified to be more descriptive. For a detailed explanation of the variable names, refer to the 'features_info.txt' file in the UCI HAR Dataset.
